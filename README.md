# prime
Prime numbers have always interested me, especially gigantic ones. The python program in here is a gigantic resource hog and ended up melting an old desktop. Obviously, that's not good.

It's been on my list to try to make this more efficient but python can only take me so far. Remaking this in C++ or JS has intrigued me but this program took basically all of the 2021 spring to make, so I've been reluctant to start.
(That and my god-awful procrastination). So for now, most of the other programs in here are probs going to be smaller, even less efficient ones.
